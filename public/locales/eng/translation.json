This by holding small gatherings for various occasions where residents could drink and eat as they mingled amongst their fellow residents. This idea has now grown into a bigger community where now events are organized on a bigger scale in our growing neighbourhood.",

From festive or recreational walks in parks to onsite Newyear&apos;s drink, Easter or Summer BBQ gatherings, DRE likes to switch it up so that young and old find something worth attending. More creative events are in the making and if you have a great idea do let us know or join our team to make a difference."
