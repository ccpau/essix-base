          Depot Rato Events is the result of a small neighborhood idea of a handful of residents to bring an entire
          neighborhood together. This by holding small gatherings for various occasions where residents could drink and
          eat as they mingled amongst their fellow residents. This idea has now grown into a bigger community where now
          events are organized on a bigger scale in our growing neighborhood.

        <div className="text-xl py-4">The Neighborhood</div>
        <div className="text-justify pb-4">
          The community is made up of residents in Muizen, Mechelen who reside in and around Depot Rato, Durabrik,
          Lotelingstraat, Leuvensesteenweg, etc. Anyone who lives in the vicinity and would like to be part of the
          community is more than welcome to join us in any future events or gatherings.

          There has been a variety of events and gathers held these past years some of them at Depot Rato itself while
          other events have been offsite. From festive or recreational walks in parks to onsite Newyear&apos;s drink,
          Easter or Summer BBQ gatherings, DRE likes to switch it up so that young and old find something worth
          attending. More creative events are in the making and if you have a great idea do let us know or join our team
          to make a difference.
